Modern day weather apps can look so complicated and packed with information, ever wanted something so simple and direct, that you simply enter the location and it gives you just the right amount of information? Well look no further than here...

## Example
Go on the website, and type in a location, then hit the search button, you'll get weather information that looks liket his:
```
Bath, Bath And North East Somerset, England, United Kingdom
Sunny. It is currently 22 degrees Celcius out. It feels like 25. UV is index is at 6.
```
And yes, you don't have to type in the exact location, all I typed for this example was bath.

If you want to know the weather of your vicinity, hit the ```Current Location``` button instead.

## To use:
Go on https://simple-weather-app-u47f.onrender.com/

## To run locally
1. Clone this repo by running ```git clone <repo url>``` at desired directory
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies
3. Run ```npm run start``` to start the server locally, or run ```npm run dev``` to run in development mode (note that nodemon needs to installed additionally as a dev dependency)

To install nodemon as a dev dependency:

_location and weather information comes from mapbox and darksky APIs respectively_

Enjoy!
